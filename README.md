Parallel ADWT (adaptive discrete wavelet transformation)
========================================================

This is the main repository for development od parallel JPEG2000 compression 
algorithm.

The project is the thesis for my B. Sc. diploma in University of Zagreb, 
Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER), and as such is not
currently open for contribution.

When I graduate, the project will change it's status to open, if someone is 
interested in working with it.


About the project
-----------------

The goal of the project is to succesfully implement 2D ADWT on both NVIDIA CUDA 
and CPU platforms. 

ADWT is currently developed and imlemented in Matlab by Damir Sersic and 
Ana Sovic on Department of Electronic Systems and Information Processing, 
Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing.
